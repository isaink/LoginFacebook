# LoginFacebook
Create a visual clone of the Facebook login page. Try and make your login page look as closely to the real thing as possible. If there is responsive design, implement it. Remember mobile first design is best. Chrome extension colorzilla is your friend. Same with page measurement tools like page ruler redux. This task will be hard, but you can do it!!! Stay patient and try new things.
